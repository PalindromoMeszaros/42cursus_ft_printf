### Challenge
**Subject** *The project covers the expected behaviour of printf for the mandatory conversions and replicates printf for most undefined behaviours*
  
ft_printf must achieve the following mandatory requirements:  
  
* Manage the following conversions: `s`, `p`, `d`, `i`, `u`, `x`, `X`, `c`
* Manage `%%`
* Manage the flags `0`, `-`, `.` & `*`
* Manage the minimum field-width
* Manage the precision
  
Standard library functions can't be used. We are able to use any function made by ourselves and included in ft_libft. We can use the functions `write`, `malloc`, `free` & `exit`
The function must conform to 42's norm.
